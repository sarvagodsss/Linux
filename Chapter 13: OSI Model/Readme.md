🌐 OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

📌 What is OSI Model?

The OSI Model is a conceptual framework that describes how data is transmitted over a network. It divides communication into 7 layers, where each layer has a specific role in data transmission.

📌 7 Layers of the OSI Model

1️⃣ Physical Layer
Deals with hardware transmission of raw data (bits) over cables, Wi-Fi, fiber optics, etc.
Responsible for voltage, signal rates, connectors, and physical topology.
👉 Examples:

Ethernet cables, switches, hubs, Wi-Fi, fiber optics.
Devices: Network Interface Card (NIC), repeater, modem.

2️⃣ Data Link Layer
Provides error detection and correction for data frames.
Ensures reliable transfer of data between two devices in the same network.
Divided into MAC (Media Access Control) and LLC (Logical Link Control).
👉 Examples:

Ethernet, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).
Devices: Switches, bridges.

3️⃣ Network Layer
Responsible for routing packets from source to destination across networks.
Uses logical addressing (IP addresses).
👉 Examples:

Protocols: IP (IPv4/IPv6), ICMP, IPsec.
Devices: Routers, Layer 3 switches.

4️⃣ Transport Layer
Ensures end-to-end communication and reliability.
Provides segmentation, flow control, and error recovery.
Can be connection-oriented (TCP) or connectionless (UDP).
👉 Examples:

Protocols: TCP, UDP.

Use Cases:

TCP → Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), Email (SMTP, IMAP).
UDP → Video streaming, VoIP, online gaming.

5️⃣ Session Layer
Manages and controls sessions (connections) between applications.
Responsible for authentication, session checkpoints, and recovery.
👉 Examples:

Protocols: NetBIOS, RPC (Remote Procedure Call), PPTP (VPN tunneling).
Example: A user logging into a remote server (session established & maintained).

6️⃣ Presentation Layer
Translates data formats between application and network.
Handles encryption, compression, and encoding.
👉 Examples:

Formats: JPEG, GIF, PNG, MP3, MP4, ASCII, EBCDIC.
Encryption: SSL/TLS.
Example: A website uses HTTPS (TLS) to encrypt communication.

7️⃣ Application Layer
Closest to the end user, provides network services directly to applications.
Responsible for communication between apps across networks.
👉 Examples:

Protocols: HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, POP3, DNS, DHCP.
Applications: Web browsers, email clients, cloud apps.
📌 Example: Sending an Email (SMTP) via OSI Model
Application Layer → User writes an email (SMTP used).
Presentation Layer → Email text encoded, attachments compressed.
Session Layer → Session established between sender & email server.
Transport Layer → TCP ensures reliable delivery.
Network Layer → IP address of mail server resolved via DNS.
Data Link Layer → Ethernet/Wi-Fi ensures frame delivery.
Physical Layer → Bits transmitted as electrical signals/waves.
📌 Example: Opening a Website (HTTP over HTTPS)
Application → Browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request.
Presentation → Data encrypted using SSL/TLS.
Session → Secure session maintained between browser & server.
Transport → TCP ensures reliable connection.
Network → IP routing finds the path to the server.
Data Link → MAC address ensures hop-to-hop delivery.
Physical → Data transmitted as signals over cable/Wi-Fi.
📌 OSI Model vs TCP/IP Model
Feature	OSI Model (7 Layers)	TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
Layers	7 (Physical → Application)	4 (Link, Internet, Transport, Application)
Example Usage	Theoretical model	Practical implementation (used in real networks)
Protocols	ARP, IP, TCP, HTTP, etc.	TCP, IP, HTTP, FTP, etc.
