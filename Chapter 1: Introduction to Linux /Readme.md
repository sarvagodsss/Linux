🐧 Introduction to Linux
Linux is a free and open-source operating system based on UNIX. It powers everything from smartphones and web servers to supercomputers and personal desktops. Unlike proprietary operating systems like Windows or macOS, Linux is developed collaboratively and is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

📘 What is Linux?
Linux is technically the kernel, the core part of the operating system that manages hardware resources. However, the term “Linux” is often used to describe the entire operating system, which includes:

Linux Kernel
GNU Utilities (shell, compiler, file utilities, etc.)
Desktop Environment (e.g., GNOME, KDE, XFCE)
Package Manager (e.g., APT, YUM, DNF, Pacman)
Applications (Firefox, LibreOffice, etc.)
📜 History of Linux
1969 – UNIX developed at Bell Labs.
1983 – GNU Project launched by Richard Stallman.
1991 – Linus Torvalds creates the Linux kernel as a personal project.
1992 – Linux becomes compatible with the GNU system → full operating system.
🔑 Key Features of Linux
Feature	Description
🆓 Open Source	Linux is freely available for use, modification, and distribution.
🛡️ Secure	Multi-user, permission-based system with regular security patches.
📁 File System	Follows a standard hierarchical filesystem structure.
📦 Package Management	Install, update, and remove software easily with tools like APT or YUM.
🔄 Multitasking	Run multiple applications/processes simultaneously.
👨‍💻 Customizable	From lightweight distros to full desktops, Linux is highly customizable.
🖥️ Popular Linux Distributions (Distros)
Distribution	Description
Ubuntu	Beginner-friendly, Debian-based, widely used.
Debian	Stable, community-driven, basis for many other distros.
Fedora	Red Hat–sponsored, cutting-edge technologies.
CentOS / AlmaLinux	Enterprise-focused, based on RHEL.

🏗️ Linux Architecture
+-----------------------------+ | Applications | +-----------------------------+ | Shell / Command Line | +-----------------------------+ | System Libraries | +-----------------------------+ | Kernel | +-----------------------------+ | Hardware Layer | +-----------------------------+

Kernel: Core of the system, interacts with hardware.
System Libraries: Provide functionality to programs.
Shell: Interface between user and OS.
Applications: Text editors, web browsers, etc.
🌐 Linux in the Real World
Linux is everywhere:

Web Servers (Apache, NGINX)
Cloud Platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
IoT Devices (Raspberry Pi, embedded systems)
Android OS (built on Linux kernel)
Supercomputers (Over 90% use Linux)
Developer Tools (Preferred environment for programming and scripting)
🔧 Why Use Linux?
Free and open source
Secure and stable
Lightweight and fast
