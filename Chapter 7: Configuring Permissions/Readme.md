Linux File System Security & Permissions

Linux File System Security restricts users from accessing files and directories without proper permissions. Users require permissions to access files or directories.

The ls -l or ll command can be used to check the security of any file or directory. These commands display contents of a directory along with security details.

Checking File and Directory Permissions

Example:

[root@ip-172-31-19-5 ~]# ll /root

total 8

-rw-------. 1 root root 6577 Aug 20 2025 pune.txt

To check the security of a directory:

[root@ip-172-31-19-5 ~]# ll -d /root

dr-xr-x---. 3 root root 181 Aug 5 10:46 /root

image

File Permission Fields

The output of ll contains 10 fields:

File type

Owner Permissions

Group Permissions

Other User Permissions

Link Count

Owner of file/directory

Group owner of file/directory

File Size

Creation Date and Time

File/Directory Name

File Types in Linux

There are seven types of files in Linux:

File Type	Symbol	Example

Normal/Regular File	-	/etc/passwd

Directory	d	/home

Link File	l	/etc/grub.conf

Block Device File	b	/dev/vdb

Character Device File	c	/dev/pts/0

Socket File	s	/dev/log

Named Pipe File	p	/dev/initctl

Description:

Regular File: Most common file type (text, images, binaries, libraries, etc.).

Directory: Stores other files, created using mkdir.

Character Device File: Communicates with devices (keyboard, mouse, etc.).

Block Device File: Used for hardware like hard drives and memory.

Socket File: Used for communication between processes (e.g., syslog, X Windows).

Named Pipe: Communication between processes, created using mknod.

Symbolic Link: Acts as a pointer to an original file.

Link Count

Reference Count = number of links to a file/directory.

Default Link Count:

File → 1

Directory → 2

When a new directory is created, the parent directory’s link count increases by 1.

Hard Link vs Soft Link

Feature	Hard Link	Soft Link (Symbolic Link)

Inode Number	Same as original file	Different from original file

Content	Contains actual data	Contains path to original file

Size	Same as original file	Depends on path length

Link Count Effect	Increases/decreases link count	Does not affect link count

File Removal Effect	Removing original file keeps hardlink intact	Removing original file breaks softlink

Directory Support	Cannot create hardlink for directory	Can create softlink for directory

Syntax
# ln <original_file> <hardlink_name>      # Create hardlink

# ln -s <original_file> <softlink_name>   # Create softlink

Example
[root@ip-172-31-19-5 ~]# touch hard.txt

[root@ip-172-31-19-5 ~]# ln hard.txt hardlink

[root@ip-172-31-19-5 ~]# touch soft.txt

[root@ip-172-31-19-5 ~]# ln -s soft.txt softlink

[root@ip-172-31-19-5 ~]# ll

total 4

-rw-r--r--. 2 root root 817 Aug 24 18:26 hardlink

lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 21 Aug 24 18:26 softlink -> soft.txt

User and Group Ownership

By default, the user who creates a file/directory is the owner.

The primary group of the user becomes the group owner.

Ownership is shown in the 6th and 7th fields of the ll command output.

Commands
# chown <user_name>:<group_name> <file/dir_name>   # Change owner and group

# chgrp <group_name> <file/dir_name>               # Change group ownership

Examples

Change User Ownership

[root@server ~]# touch samplefile.txt

[root@server ~]# ll
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 Aug 15 08:56 samplefile.txt

[root@server ~]# chown mahesh samplefile.txt

[root@server ~]# ll

-rw-r--r--. 1 mahesh root 0 Aug 15 08:57 samplefile.txt

Change Group Ownership

[root@server ~]# chgrp nagpur samplefile.txt

[root@server ~]# ll

-rw-r--r--. 1 mahesh nagpur 0 Aug 29 08:57 samplefile.txt

Change User and Group Ownership Together

[root@server ~]# chown vaihav:TCS samplefile.txt

[root@server ~]# ll

-rw-r--r--. 1 vaibhav TCS 0 Aug 15 08:57 samplefile.txt

Managing Permissions in Linux

In Linux, file and directory access is controlled using permissions. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th fields of file attributes represent permissions for:

Owner

Group owner

Other users

Each field contains three basic permissions:

Read (r)

Write (w)

Execute (x)

The effect of these permissions differs for files and directories.

File and Directory Permissions

Permission	Applied to Files	Applied to Directories	Symbol (Letter)	Number

Read	Open a file	List contents of directory	r	4

Write	Change contents of a file	Create, delete, and modify permissions on files	w	2

Execute	Run a program file	Change to the directory	x	1

Changing Permissions Using Symbols

Syntax:

chmod <u,g,o><+,-,=><r,w,x> <file_name>
Symbols:

Symbol	Description

u	Owner permission

g	Group permission

o	Other users permission

+	Add permission
+	
-	Remove permission

-	
=	Assign permission

r	Read permission

w	Write permission

x	Execute permission

Examples
1. Give write permission to group

mkdir /pune

chmod g+w /pune/

ls -ld /pune/

drwxrwxr-x. 2 root root 6 Aug 15 06:14 /pune/

2. Remove read and execute permission for other users

chmod o-rx /pune/

ls -ld /pune

drwxrwx---. 2 root root 6 Aug 15 06:14 /pune

3. Assign read-only permission for group and other users

chmod go=r /pune/

ls -ld /pune

drwxr--r--. 2 root root 6 Aug 15 06:14 /pune

4. Give execute permission to owner of a file

touch samplefile3.txt

chmod u+rwx samplefile3.txt

ll
-rwxr--r--. 1 root root 0 Aug 15 09:29 samplefile3.txt

5. Remove read permission for group and assign read/write to others

chmod g-r,o=rw samplefile3.txt

ls -l samplefile3.txt

-rwx---rw-. 1 root root 0 Aug 15 09:29 samplefile3.txt

Changing Permissions Using Octal Numbers

Syntax:

chmod <permission_in_numbers> <file_name>

Octal Permission Representation

Octal No	Binary	Permission
0	000	---
1	001	--x
2	010	-w-
3	011	-wx
4	100	r--
5	101	r-x
6	110	rw-
7	111	rwx

Examples
1. Apply octal permission 421

mkdir /roshan

chmod 421 /roshan/

ls -ld /roshan/

dr---w---x. 2 root root 6 Aug 15 07:10 /roshan/

2. Apply octal permission 732

chmod 732 /roshan/

ls -ld /roshan/

drwx-wx-w-. 2 root root 6 Aug 15 07:10 /roshan/

3. Apply octal permission 644

chmod 644 /roshan/

ls -ld /roshan/

drw-r--r--. 2 root root 6 Aug 15 07:10 /roshan/

4. Apply octal permission 755

chmod 755 /roshan/

ls -ld /roshan/
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 6 Aug 15 07:10 /roshan/

Default Permissions and Umask in Linux

Default Permissions

When a user creates a file or directory in Linux, default permissions are assigned based on whether the user is root or a standard user. These default values are determined by the umask.

File (by default fully open: 666)

Directory (by default fully open: 777)

Default Permissions for Root and Standard User

User	Directory	File

Root	755	644

Standard User	775	664

Calculating Permission with Umask

The umask value masks what is considered to be fully opened permissions.

For Directory → 777 - umask

For File → 666 - umask

Example Calculation

USER	Type	Calculation	Permission

Root	Dir	777 - 022	755

Root	File	666 - 022	644

Standard	Dir	777 - 002	775

Standard	File	666 - 002	664

Checking Default Umask

# Default umask for root user

[root@linux ~]# umask

0022

# Umask for standard user

[student@linux ~]$ umask

0002
Changing Umask Value

Temporary Change

[root@linux ~]# umask 000

[root@linux ~]# mkdir demo

[root@linux ~]# ll

drwxrwxrwx. 2 root root 6 Aug 15 12:34 demo

This change lasts until the session ends.

Permanent Change

To make umask changes permanent, update /etc/profile.

[root@linux ~]# vim /etc/profile

59 if [ $UID -gt 199 ] && [ "`/usr/bin/id -gn`" = "`/usr/bin/id -un`" ]; then

60     umask 002   # change value for standard user (line 60)
61 else
62     umask 000   # change value for root (line 62)
63 fi

:wq

Reload profile and verify:

[root@linux ~]# source /etc/profile

[root@linux ~]# umask

0000

⭐ Special Permissions

In Linux, apart from the basic file permissions (read, write, execute), there are three types of special permissions:

SUID (Set User ID)

SGID (Set Group ID)

Sticky Bit

Permission Table

Name	Numeric Value	Relative Value	On Files	Symbol

SUID	4	u+s	User executes file with permissions of file owner	s

SGID	2	g+s	User executes file with permissions of group owner. Files created in directory get the same group owner.	s

Sticky Bit	1	o+t	Prevents users from deleting files of other users in a shared directory	t

1. SUID (Set User ID)
2. 
SUID is a special type of file permission given to a file. Normally in Linux/UNIX, when a program runs, it inherits access permissions from the logged-in user.

With SUID enabled, a user can run the file with the permissions of the file owner (usually root).

👉 In simple words: Users get the file owner’s permissions temporarily when executing a file/program.

Syntax

chmod u+s <file_name>

Example

# As user (without SUID permission)

[shubham@server ~]$ dmidecode

Permission denied

# As root, apply SUID

[root@server ~]# chmod u+s /sbin/dmidecode

[root@server ~]# ls -l /sbin/dmidecode

-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 110608 Aug 20 2025 /sbin/dmidecode

# Now any user can run it

[shubham@server ~]$ dmidecode

Getting SMBIOS data from sysfs...

2. SGID (Set Group ID)
3. 
SGID can be applied to directories. When SGID is set on a directory:

Files created inside the directory automatically inherit the group ownership of the directory, instead of the user's primary group.
Syntax

chmod g+s <directory_name>

Example
# Create directory and set group
[root@server ~]# mkdir /demo
[root@server ~]# chgrp TCS /demo
[root@server ~]# ls -ld /demo
drwxr-xr-x 2 root TCS 6 Aug 12 05:55 /demo

# Apply SGID
[root@server ~]# chmod g+s /demo
[root@server ~]# ls -ld /demo
drwxr-sr-x 2 root TCS 31 Aug 12 05:57 /demo

# Now files inside inherit group TCS
[root@server ~]# touch /demo/file1
[root@server ~]# ls -l /demo
-rw-r--r-- 1 root TCS 0 Aug 12 05:57 file1
3. Sticky Bit
Sticky Bit is used on directories to prevent users from deleting other users’ files.

If Sticky Bit is set on a directory:

Only the owner of the file and the root user can delete the file.
Other users cannot delete files they don’t own.
This is commonly used in /tmp directory.

Syntax
chmod o+t <directory_name>
Example
# Create shared directory
[root@server ~]# mkdir /demo
[root@server ~]# chmod 777 /demo

# Apply Sticky Bit
[root@server ~]# chmod o+t /demo
[root@server ~]# ls -ld /demo
drwxrwxrwt 2 root root 6 Aug 12 05:55 /demo

# User1 creates a file
[shubham@server ~]$ touch /demo/file.txt

# Another user tries to delete it
[mahesh@server ~]$ rm -f /demo/file.txt
rm: cannot remove '/demo/file.txt': Operation not permitted
📜 ACL (Access Control List)
Introduction
Access Control List (ACL) is used to set permissions over files and directories for specific users or groups.
Unlike traditional UNIX permissions (owner, group, others), ACL provides fine-grained access control by allowing you to assign multiple users or groups different permissions on the same file or directory.

👉 Use case: Suppose a user is not part of a group that owns a file, but you still want to give them read or write permissions. Instead of changing group ownership, you can use ACL.

Commands
Set ACL (user)
  setfacl -m u:<username>:<permissions> <file/directory>
Set ACL (group)

setfacl -m g:<groupname>:<permissions> <file/directory>
Check ACL

getfacl <file/directory>
Examples
1. User Perspective
# Create directory
mkdir /project
ll -d /project
# Output:
# drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 6 Aug 12 05:55 /project

# Create users
useradd amit
useradd sumit

# Apply ACL for user 'amit'
setfacl -m u:amit:rwx /project
getfacl /project

# Switch to user 'amit'
su - amit
touch /project/amit.txt   # ✅ Successfully creates file
exit

# Apply ACL for user 'sumit'
setfacl -m u:sumit:r-- /project
su - sumit
cd /project               # ❌ Permission denied
2. Group Perspective
# Create groups
groupadd TCS
groupadd WIPRO

# Create users and add them to groups
useradd -G TCS T1
useradd -G TCS T2
useradd -G WIPRO W1
useradd -G WIPRO W2
useradd -G WIPRO W3

# Check directory
ll -ld /project
# drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 6 Aug 12 05:55 /project

# Apply ACL for groups
setfacl -m g:TCS:rwx /project
setfacl -m g:WIPRO:--- /project

# Apply ACL for a specific user inside WIPRO group
setfacl -m u:W3:rwx /project
👉 In this example, the WIPRO group has no permissions, but user W3 (member of WIPRO) still has rwx access due to ACL.

3. Copy ACL from One File to Another
# Create a new file
touch /abc.txt
getfacl /abc.txt

# Copy ACL from /project to /abc.txt
getfacl /project | setfacl --set-file=- /abc.txt

# Verify
getfacl /abc.txt
4. Remove ACL
Remove single user ACL

setfacl -x u:amit /project
Remove multiple users ACL

setfacl -x u:sumit,u:W3 /project
Remove single group ACL

setfacl -x g:IBM /project
Remove multiple groups ACL

setfacl -x g:WIPRO,g:TCS /project
Remove all ACL entries

setfacl -b /abc.txt
🛡️ SUDO Permissions
The sudo (Super User DO) command in Linux is generally used as a prefix to run commands that only the superuser is allowed to execute.
When you prefix sudo with any command, it will run that command with elevated privileges, allowing a user with proper permissions to execute a command as another user, such as the superuser.

This is the Linux equivalent of the “Run as Administrator” option in Windows.
The option of sudo lets us have multiple administrators in the system.

Requirements for Using sudo
A user must be listed in the /etc/sudoers file.
Alternatively, the user should belong to the wheel group, which is the default group that allows users to use sudo.
Syntax
sudo <command_line>
Example
[root@ip-172-31-19-21 ~]# su – amit  

[amit@ip-172-31-19-21 ~]$ useradd shubham  
-bash: /usr/sbin/useradd: Permission denied  

[amit@ip-172-31-19-21 ~]$ sudo useradd shubham
