Linux Boot Process

The Linux boot process is a sequence of stages that the operating system follows from powering on the system until the user gets a login prompt. Understanding this process is crucial for system administrators and DevOps engineers when troubleshooting boot issues.

Stages of Linux Boot Process

1. BIOS/UEFI Initialization
   
When the computer is powered on, the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) initializes the hardware.

Performs POST (Power-On Self Test) to check CPU, RAM, disk, and other components.

Looks for a bootable device (HDD, SSD, CD/DVD, USB, or Network).

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

Pressing F2 or DEL during boot enters the BIOS setup.

Boot order can be configured to prioritize HDD or USB.

2. MBR/GPT and Boot Loader
   
Once the boot device is found, BIOS/UEFI looks at the first sector of the disk:

MBR (Master Boot Record) for legacy systems (first 512 bytes).

GPT (GUID Partition Table) for modern systems.

The boot loader is loaded from here. The most common boot loaders are:

GRUB2 (GNU GRUB Boot Loader)

LILO (older Linux Loader)

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

GRUB menu appears allowing selection of kernels:

Ubuntu

Advanced options for Ubuntu

Memory test (memtest86+)

3. Kernel Loading
   
Boot loader loads the Linux Kernel into memory.

Kernel is usually stored in /boot/vmlinuz-*.

Kernel initializes hardware, mounts the root filesystem, and loads initramfs (temporary root filesystem).

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

ls /boot

vmlinuz-5.15.0-25-generic  initrd.img-5.15.0-25-generic  grub/

4. Initramfs and Hardware Detection
   
initramfs provides necessary drivers and modules required to mount the actual root filesystem.

Once the root filesystem is mounted, control is transferred to the init system.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

lsinitramfs /boot/initrd.img-$(uname -r) | less

5. Init/Systemd Process
   
Historically, /sbin/init was the first user-space program (PID 1).

Most modern Linux distributions use systemd instead of init.

It reads configuration files (like /etc/systemd/system/*.service) and starts system services.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

ps -p 1 -o comm=

# Output:

systemd

6. Runlevels/Targets
   
The init/systemd process brings the system to a specific state:


Runlevel 0 â†’ Halt

Runlevel 1 â†’ Single-user mode

Runlevel 3 â†’ Multi-user mode (CLI)

Runlevel 5 â†’ Multi-user mode (GUI)

Runlevel 6 â†’ Reboot

In systemd, these are replaced by targets:

poweroff.target

rescue.target

multi-user.target

graphical.target

reboot.target

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

systemctl get-default

# Output:

graphical.target

7. Login Prompt
   
Once all required services are up, the system presents:

TTY login prompt (CLI mode)

Display manager (GUI mode, e.g., GDM, LightDM)

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

# Switch to text-based login

Ctrl + Alt + F3

Summary of Boot Process

BIOS/UEFI â†’ MBR/GPT â†’ Boot Loader (GRUB) â†’ Kernel â†’ Initramfs â†’ Init/Systemd â†’ Runlevel/Target â†’ Login

Troubleshooting Boot Issues

GRUB Rescue Mode: Appears if GRUB configuration is broken.

Kernel Panic: Happens when the kernel cannot mount root filesystem.

Systemd Failed Services: Use systemctl status to debug.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

systemctl --failed

Practical Example of Boot Logs

You can check the boot logs using:

journalctl -b

Or to see previous boots:

journalctl --list-boots
