Linux Boot Process

The Linux boot process is a sequence of stages that the operating system follows from powering on the system until the user gets a login prompt. Understanding this process is crucial for system administrators and DevOps engineers when troubleshooting boot issues.

Stages of Linux Boot Process

1. BIOS/UEFI Initialization
   
When the computer is powered on, the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) initializes the hardware.

Performs POST (Power-On Self Test) to check CPU, RAM, disk, and other components.

Looks for a bootable device (HDD, SSD, CD/DVD, USB, or Network).

👉 Example:

Pressing F2 or DEL during boot enters the BIOS setup.

Boot order can be configured to prioritize HDD or USB.

2. MBR/GPT and Boot Loader
   
Once the boot device is found, BIOS/UEFI looks at the first sector of the disk:

MBR (Master Boot Record) for legacy systems (first 512 bytes).

GPT (GUID Partition Table) for modern systems.

The boot loader is loaded from here. The most common boot loaders are:

GRUB2 (GNU GRUB Boot Loader)

LILO (older Linux Loader)

👉 Example:

GRUB menu appears allowing selection of kernels:

Ubuntu

Advanced options for Ubuntu

Memory test (memtest86+)

3. Kernel Loading
   
Boot loader loads the Linux Kernel into memory.

Kernel is usually stored in /boot/vmlinuz-*.

Kernel initializes hardware, mounts the root filesystem, and loads initramfs (temporary root filesystem).

👉 Example:

ls /boot

vmlinuz-5.15.0-25-generic  initrd.img-5.15.0-25-generic  grub/

4. Initramfs and Hardware Detection
   
initramfs provides necessary drivers and modules required to mount the actual root filesystem.

Once the root filesystem is mounted, control is transferred to the init system.

👉 Example:

lsinitramfs /boot/initrd.img-$(uname -r) | less

5. Init/Systemd Process
   
Historically, /sbin/init was the first user-space program (PID 1).

Most modern Linux distributions use systemd instead of init.

It reads configuration files (like /etc/systemd/system/*.service) and starts system services.

👉 Example:

ps -p 1 -o comm=

# Output:

systemd

6. Runlevels/Targets
   
The init/systemd process brings the system to a specific state:


Runlevel 0 → Halt

Runlevel 1 → Single-user mode

Runlevel 3 → Multi-user mode (CLI)

Runlevel 5 → Multi-user mode (GUI)

Runlevel 6 → Reboot

In systemd, these are replaced by targets:

poweroff.target

rescue.target

multi-user.target

graphical.target

reboot.target

👉 Example:

systemctl get-default

# Output:

graphical.target

7. Login Prompt
   
Once all required services are up, the system presents:

TTY login prompt (CLI mode)

Display manager (GUI mode, e.g., GDM, LightDM)

👉 Example:

# Switch to text-based login

Ctrl + Alt + F3

Summary of Boot Process

BIOS/UEFI → MBR/GPT → Boot Loader (GRUB) → Kernel → Initramfs → Init/Systemd → Runlevel/Target → Login

Troubleshooting Boot Issues

GRUB Rescue Mode: Appears if GRUB configuration is broken.

Kernel Panic: Happens when the kernel cannot mount root filesystem.

Systemd Failed Services: Use systemctl status to debug.

👉 Example:

systemctl --failed

Practical Example of Boot Logs

You can check the boot logs using:

journalctl -b

Or to see previous boots:

journalctl --list-boots
