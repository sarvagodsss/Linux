Linux File Management System Hierarchy

The Linux operating system follows a hierarchical directory structure that looks like an inverted tree. At the top is the root directory /, and all other files and directories branch out from it.

ðŸ“‚ Root Directory (/)

The starting point of the filesystem.

Every single file and directory starts from /.

Only the root user has full permission here.

ðŸ”‘ Important Directories under /

1. /bin
   
Stands for binary.

Contains essential user command binaries (like ls, cp, mv, cat).

Needed for system booting and single-user mode.
3. /sbin

Contains system binaries.

Commands for system administration (e.g., reboot, shutdown, fdisk).

4. /etc
   
Contains system configuration files.

Examples: passwd, hosts, fstab.

6. /dev
   
Stores device files (hardware access).

Example: /dev/sda (hard disk), /dev/tty (terminals).

8. /proc
   
Virtual filesystem containing process and system information.

Example: /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/meminfo.

10. /var
    
Variable data files.

Logs (/var/log), spools, cache, lock files.

12. /tmp
    
Temporary files.

Cleared on reboot.

14. /usr
    
User-related programs and data.

Subdirectories:

/usr/bin â†’ Non-essential user commands.

/usr/sbin â†’ Non-essential system binaries.

/usr/lib â†’ Libraries.

/usr/share â†’ Shared data.

9. /home
    
Home directories for users.

Example: /home/vaibhav.

11. /root
    
Home directory for the root user.

13. /lib
    
Shared libraries needed by binaries in /bin and /sbin.

15. /boot
    
Files required for booting Linux.

Example: vmlinuz (kernel), grub (bootloader).

17. /opt
    
Optional or third-party software packages.

19. /mnt
    
Temporary mount point for filesystems.

21. /media
    
Mount point for removable devices (USB, CD-ROM).

23. /srv
    
Data for services (FTP, HTTP, etc.).

ðŸ“Œ Key Points

Linux filesystem is a single tree structure starting at /.

Every device or partition is mounted into this tree.

Configuration files are under /etc, user data in /home, executables in /bin & /usr/bin.
/proc and /sys are virtual filesystems providing runtime system information.
