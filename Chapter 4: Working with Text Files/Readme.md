Working with Text Files

In Linux, text files are the most common way to store data, configurations, and scripts. This guide covers different commands and examples to create, view, edit, search, and manipulate text files.

ðŸ“Œ 1. Creating Text Files

You can create an empty text file or add content to it.

Examples:

# Create an empty file

touch file.txt

# Create a file with content

echo "Hello World" > file.txt

# Append text to a file

echo "This is a new line" >> file.txt

# Create a file using cat

cat > notes.txt

This is a note.

Press CTRL+D to save and exit

ðŸ“Œ 2. Viewing Text Files

There are different ways to view text files.

Examples:

# Display entire file

cat file.txt

# Display file with line numbers

cat -n file.txt

# Show first 10 lines of file

head file.txt

# Show last 10 lines of file

tail file.txt

# View file in a scrolling mode

less file.txt

more file.txt

ðŸ“Œ 3. Editing Text Files

You can edit text files using editors.

Examples:

# Open file with nano editor

nano file.txt

# Open file with vi editor

vi file.txt

# Open file with vim editor

vim file.txt

ðŸ“Œ 4. Searching in Text Files

The grep command is used for searching.

Examples:

# Search for a word in file

grep "Hello" file.txt

# Search case-insensitive

grep -i "hello" file.txt

# Show line numbers with match

grep -n "line" file.txt

# Search in multiple files

grep "error" *.log

ðŸ“Œ 5. Comparing Text Files

The diff and cmp commands help compare files.

Examples:

# Compare two files line by line

diff file1.txt file2.txt

# Compare byte by byte

cmp file1.txt file2.txt

ðŸ“Œ 6. Counting in Text Files

The wc command helps count lines, words, and characters.

Examples:

# Count lines, words, and characters

wc file.txt

# Only count lines

wc -l file.txt

wc -w file.txt

# Only count characters

wc -m file.txt

ðŸ“Œ 7. Sorting Text Files

The sort command sorts file contents.

Examples:

# Sort alphabetically

sort file.txt

# Sort in reverse order

sort -r file.txt

# Remove duplicates

sort -u file.txt

ðŸ“Œ 8. Combining Text Files

You can merge multiple files.

Examples:

# Combine files into one

cat file1.txt file2.txt > merged.txt

# Append file2 to file1

cat file2.txt >> file1.txt

ðŸ“Œ 9. Replacing and Editing Text

The sed command is used for editing text.

Examples:

# Replace 'Hello' with 'Hi' in file

sed 's/Hello/Hi/' file.txt

# Replace all occurrences in file

sed 's/Hello/Hi/g' file.txt

# Delete a line (e.g., line 2)

sed '2d' file.txt

ðŸ“Œ 10. Extracting Text

The cut and awk commands are used.

Examples:

# Extract first 10 characters of each line

cut -c 1-10 file.txt

# Extract the first column (default delimiter is TAB)

cut -f1 file.txt

# Extract using delimiter (:)

cut -d ":" -f1 /etc/passwd

# Print specific column using awk

awk '{print $1}' file.txt

ðŸ“Œ 11. Execute Multiple Commands

Semicolon (;) â€“ Executes two or more commands in same command line argument.

Examples:

 touch /abc.txt ; mkdir /mydir ; cp â€“r /mnt /media
 
Pipe (|) â€“ It matches first command output to the second command and execute it
