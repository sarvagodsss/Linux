📦 Managing Software

Linux systems use package managers to install, update, and remove software. Package management varies based on the distribution family (Debian-based, Red Hat-based, etc.).

1. Package Management Tools
   
Debian/Ubuntu (APT – Advanced Package Tool)

apt update → Updates the package index.

apt upgrade → Upgrades all installed packages.

apt install package_name → Installs a new package.

apt remove package_name → Removes a package.

apt purge package_name → Removes a package with configuration files.

apt search package_name → Search for a package.

dpkg -i package.deb → Install a .deb file manually.

Example:

sudo apt update

sudo apt install nginx -y

Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora (YUM/DNF)

yum install package_name → Installs a package (older versions).

dnf install package_name → Installs a package (newer versions).

yum remove package_name → Removes a package.

yum update → Updates all packages.

rpm -ivh package.rpm → Installs an .rpm file manually.

dnf search package_name → Search for a package.

Example:

sudo dnf install httpd -y

2. Source Code Installation
   
Sometimes software is not available in repositories and must be compiled from source

Steps:

wget http://example.com/software.tar.gz

 tar -xvzf software.tar.gz
 
 cd software
 
 ./configure
 
 make
 
 sudo make install
 
3. Snap Packages (Universal)
   
snap install package_name → Install snap package.

snap remove package_name → Remove snap package.

snap list → List installed snaps.

Example:

sudo snap install vlc

4. Checking Installed Software
   
Debian/Ubuntu → dpkg -l | grep package

RHEL/CentOS/Fedora → rpm -qa | grep package

6. Upgrading and Removing Software
   
Debian/Ubuntu → apt upgrade / apt remove package

RHEL/CentOS → yum update / yum remove package
