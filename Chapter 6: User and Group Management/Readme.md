Linux User and Group Management

Managing users and groups is an essential part of Linux system administration. It allows administrators to control access, security, and resource usage across the system.


👤 Users in Linux

A user represents an account that can log into the system and execute processes.

Types of Users

Super User (Root)

UID = 0

Full administrative privileges.

Home directory: /root.

Use sudo for safer administration.

System Users

Created automatically by the system or applications.

Run background services (e.g., mysql, www-data).

Usually have no login shell.

Standard Users

Regular accounts for real people.

Limited privileges.

Home directory: /home/username.

📌 UID and GID

UID (User ID): Unique ID for each user.

Root → UID 0

System users → UID 1–999

Standard users → UID 1000+

GID (Group ID): Unique ID for each group.

📂 Important Files for User Management

/etc/passwd → Stores user account information.

/etc/shadow → Stores encrypted user passwords.

/etc/group → Stores group information.

/etc/gshadow → Secure group account information.

📂 Important Files

📌 /etc/passwd

Stores user account information.

Each line represents a user.

Format:

username:x:UID:GID:comment:home_directory:shell

Example:

vaibhav:x:1001:1001:This is linux batch:/home/vaibhav:/bin/bash

📌 /etc/group

Stores group information.

Format:

group_name:x:GID:user_list

Example:

devops:x:1002:vaibhav,rahul

📌 /etc/shadow

Stores encrypted user passwords and password policies.

Only accessible by root.

Format:

username:encrypted_password:last_change:min:max:warn:inactive:expire

Example:

vaibhav:$6$Qk9as..:19344:0:99999:7:::

📌 /etc/gshadow

Stores secure group information (encrypted passwords for groups).

Format:

group_name:password:admin_list:member_list

Example:

devops:!:vaibhav:rahul

Skeleton Files (/etc/skel)

Default files copied to a new user's home directory.

Example:

ls /etc/skel

.bashrc  .profile  .bash_logout

.bash_logout => If this file is missing, user will unable to logout from the system.

.bash_profile => If this file is missing, home directory will not be assigned to the new user.

.bashrc => If this file is missing, user will unable to login to the system.

Switching Between Users

Switch User

su - vaibhav

Switch to Root User

su -

sudo -i

➕ Adding a New User

useradd username → Create a new user.

passwd username → Assign password to user.

usermod -aG groupname username → Add user to a group.

adduser username (Debian/Ubuntu) → Interactive user creation.

🔐 Password Management (passwd Command)

Password management in Linux is an essential part of user and group administration. It ensures system security by controlling how user passwords are created, stored, and maintained.

passwd username → Change a user’s password.

passwd -e username → Force password change on next login.

chage -l username → View password aging policy.

chage -M 60 username → Set password validity (60 days).

View & Change Password Policy

cat /etc/login.defs → View default password policy.

vim /etc/pam.d/common-password → Configure password complexity rules.

The password is a secret phrase used to log in to the system.

The passwd command is used to assign or change the password of any user.

Root user can change the password of any user.

Local users can change only their own password
.
Passwords are stored in /etc/shadow file in encrypted format.

Password Rules

Must be at least 8 characters long

Should not contain the username

Cannot reuse the old password

Dictionary words are not allowed

Should not be too simplistic

Syntax

# passwd             # Change current user's password

# passwd <username>  # Assign or change another user's password (root only)

Examples

1. Changing root user’s password
   
[root@ip-172-31-19-5 ~]# passwd

Changing password for user root.

New password:

BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 8 characters

Retype new password:

passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.

3. Changing a local user’s password by root
   
[root@ip-172-31-19-5 ~]# passwd vaibhav

Changing password for user vaibhav.

New password:

BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 8 characters

Retype new password:

passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.

5. Changing current user’s password (self-change)
   
[vaibhav@ip-172-31-19-5 ~]$ passwd

Changing password for user vaibhav.

Changing password for vaibhav.

(current) UNIX password:

New password:

Retype new password:

passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.

7. Trying to change another user’s password (without root privilege)
   
[vaibhav@ip-172-31-19-5 ~]$ passwd ubuntu

passwd: Only root can specify a user name.

Password Storage in /etc/shadow

Passwords are stored in encrypted format inside /etc/shadow.

Example:

[root@ip-172-31-19-5 ~]# tail -1 /etc/shadow

vaibhav:$6$S59rUkc4$iIusUTs6TPb2ueLMty3/2kvShejrTVctesfLYyUwTa78kDQQ/O/f954EuyomO6nBwwiPyqPt4hAij5OxiQIQ5.:18206:0:99999:7:::

📌 Key Files for Password Management

/etc/passwd

Stores basic user account information.

Password field is usually x (actual passwords are kept in /etc/shadow).

Example entry:

vaibhav:x:1001:1001:this is linux batch:/home/vaibhav:/bin/bash

/etc/shadow

Stores hashed passwords and password aging information.

Only accessible by the root user.

Example entry:

vaibhav:$6$2Wf...$abcd123:19453:0:90:7:14:19600:

Fields:

Username

Encrypted Password

Last Password Change (days since Jan 1, 1970)

Min Days (before password can be changed again)

Max Days (validity of password)

Warning Days (before expiration)

Inactive Days (after expiration)

Expiration Date

For Future use

/etc/login.defs

Contains default password policy and user account settings.

Example parameters:

PASS_MAX_DAYS   90   # Max password age

PASS_MIN_DAYS   0    # Min password age

PASS_WARN_AGE   7    # Warn user before expiry

/etc/pam.d/

Contains PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) configurations for enforcing password complexity and authentication.

Example: /etc/pam.d/common-password

📌 Password Policies

1. Password Aging Policy (/etc/login.defs)
   
PASS_MAX_DAYS → Maximum days password is valid.

PASS_MIN_DAYS → Minimum days before user can change password.

PASS_WARN_AGE → Warning days before password expires.

Example:

PASS_MAX_DAYS   90

PASS_MIN_DAYS   7

PASS_WARN_AGE   14

2. Password Complexity Policy (via PAM)
3. 
Edit /etc/pam.d/common-password (Debian/Ubuntu) or /etc/pam.d/system-auth (RHEL/CentOS).

Example rule:

password requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3 minlen=8 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1

minlen=8 → Minimum 8 characters

ucredit=-1 → At least 1 uppercase letter

lcredit=-1 → At least 1 lowercase letter

dcredit=-1 → At least 1 digit

ocredit=-1 → At least 1 special character

📌 Examples

👥 Group Administration/Management

groupadd groupname → Create a new group.

groupdel groupname → Delete a group.

groups username → Show groups for a user.

gpasswd -a username groupname → Add user to group.

gpasswd -d username groupname → Remove user from group.

Primary Group

Every user must belong to one primary group.

A user can only have one primary group.

When creating files, the primary group becomes the group owner of these files.

Primary group membership is defined in /etc/passwd.

Secondary (or Supplementary) Groups

Users can belong to one or more secondary groups.

Secondary groups are important for granting additional file access.

If the group a user belongs to has access to certain files, the user gains access as well.

Group membership is stored in the /etc/group file.

📌 /etc/group File

The /etc/group file contains all group-related information.

Each line has four fields separated by colons (:):

Group Name → Name of the group.

Group Password (Optional) → Rarely used nowadays. A temporary password could allow users to join groups.

Group ID (GID) → Unique numeric ID assigned to the group.

List of Members → Users who are members of the group as a secondary group.

Users with this group as their primary group will not be listed here.

Group Management Commands

1. Create a Group
The groupadd command is used to add a group in the system. Group information is stored in /etc/group.
